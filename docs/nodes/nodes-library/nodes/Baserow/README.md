## Basic Operations

The Baserow node is able to call basic API endpoint to any configured Baserow
instance.

<Resource node="n8n-nodes-base.baserow" />

## Example usage

This workflow allows you to create, find and delete rows in Baserow default Customer table.

This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.

- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Set](../../core-nodes/Set/README.md)
- [Baserow]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

For this workflow you need an account to any Baserow instance with 
the demo table `Customers`. View the API doc to get the table id you
have to use later.
